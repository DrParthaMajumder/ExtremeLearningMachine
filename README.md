# Extreme Learning Machine
Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a machine learning algorithm that was proposed as an efficient and fast learning method for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs). It was first introduced by Huang et al. in 2006.
Unlike traditional neural network architectures, ELM has a unique characteristic: the weights connecting the input layer to the hidden layer are randomly generated and fixed. These random weights are not updated during the learning process. Instead, only the weights connecting the hidden layer to the output layer are learned. The learning process in ELM involves two main steps: initialization and training. In the initialization step, the random input weights are generated, and the hidden layer activation function is chosen (commonly the sigmoid or radial basis function). The output weights are then calculated using a linear regression technique. During the training step, the output weights are adjusted to minimize the error between the predicted and target outputs.

ELM is known for its fast learning speed, as it only requires a one-time random weight initialization and a simple output weight calculation. This eliminates the iterative training process commonly found in traditional neural networks, making ELM significantly faster and more efficient. ELM has several advantages and applications. Some key advantages include:

**Computational Efficiency:**

ELM is computationally efficient due to its simple and fast learning process. This makes it suitable for large-scale datasets and real-time applications.

**Universal Approximation:** 

ELM has been proven to have universal approximation capabilities, meaning it can approximate any continuous function with arbitrary precision given enough hidden neurons.

**Robustness: **

ELM is robust to overfitting since the input weights are fixed and randomly initialized. This helps prevent the model from memorizing the training data.
ELM has found applications in various domains, including regression, classification, pattern recognition, time series prediction, and feature learning. It has been successfully used in fields such as image and speech recognition, bioinformatics, finance, and many others.

In summary, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a fast and efficient learning algorithm for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks. It offers computational efficiency, universal approximation capabilities, and robustness to overfitting. With its simplicity and effectiveness, ELM has gained popularity and demonstrated success in various machine learning applications.
